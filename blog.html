<h2>GETTING OUT OF COMFORTZONE</h2>
<P>Somethings that kills teens is being in comfortzone something that makes them think that their life is actually complete therefore they dont need to do and put hardwork,therefore when one get themselves from being in the zone where theyre so comfy they will get up and start realising their purpose in life</P>

<h2>ORGANIZATION</h2>
<P>Teens can organise their life in a way that they will be able to have fun with their peers so they dont feel like theyre left out meanwhile they know their goals and theyve self discipline.This will help them be able to multitask for theyll be ablemto stay focus on their goals have fun with their friends </P>
<h2>SELF DIRECTIVENESS</h2> 
<P>Self directivness is the self drive which makes one be able to push themselves with zero forcing.Therefore by having sucha  thing a teeen at his|her age can be able to put efforts in their dreams and ambitions so they can fulfill.</P>
<h2>CRITICALITY</h2> 
<P>Teenages tend not to think out of the box most of the times ive therefore concluded it to be a subject of discussion so they can get help ,therefore for a teenage to be able to make big moves then they must be ready to deal and encounter big things<p></p>
